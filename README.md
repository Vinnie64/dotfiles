# These are my dotfiles
run `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRealYougCraft/personal-scripts/master/arch_setup)"` for the full setup.

Visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRealYougCraft/personal-scripts/master/arch_setup before running the script to check if you really want to run all commands present. The script is intended to get newly installed distros up and running in one command.

Also, it's mainly intended for ME personally. Check through all files and scripts to see what you need and what you don't.

Furthermore, my i3 config is meant for dual-monitor setup but also works with single monitor setups.
